# freelan-guide-for-windows-users

This project is a hands-on documentation about installing, setting-up and using FreeLAN on Microsoft Windows (7 and up),
intended for beginner-level computer users and above. 
Various difficulties and errors are listed with their explanations and solutions, in order to allow anyone to successfully use it.
The guide is available in French and will be available in English shortly.
If you want translate to another language, feel free to submit your version.


The developpers of FreeLAN have delivered many versions and updates, for free and on their free time,
but the online documentation is mostly intended at advanced linux users, and hasn't been as thoroughly updated since its creation.


The guide is available in .odt format, which can be opened with OpenOffice or LibreOffice.

Please open an issue if you have any difficulty concerning the guide or spot any error or mistranslation.
Issues with FreeLAN should be reported to the developpers on the FreeLAN-developper github page.
